# Even Odd Number Sorter App

A simple Python app that sorts any list of comma-separated numbers into even and odd groups, then displays each group in order.

## How it works

- Enter a string of numbers separated by commas (spaces and special characters are ignored).
- The app tells you which numbers are even and which are odd.
- Both groups are sorted and displayed.
- You can run the app as many times as you want.
- When you finish, you get a fun ASCII art reward!

## Usage

1. Run `python evenodd.py`.
2. Follow the prompts to enter your numbers and view the results.

## Example

```
Welcome to my Even Odd Number Sorter App!
Please enter comma-separated numbers: 1, 2, 3, 6, 18, 9, 4, 13, 22
---- Result Summary ----
1 is odd!
2 is even!
3 is odd!
6 is even!
18 is even!
9 is odd!
4 is even!
13 is odd!

The following 5 numbers are even:
2
4
6
18
22

The following 4 numbers are odd:
